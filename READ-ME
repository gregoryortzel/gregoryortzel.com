Gregory Antonio Ortega Zelaya
The repository at hand is a personal resume website.

Utilizing all of the abilities I've gained in software and graphical development, the aim of this website is to show my abilities synergizing to create a complex, functional, and engaging end product.

My background is in more artistic pursuits, namely web cartoons, animation, game development, and video production. Many of these pursuits necessitated that I become more educated in software development, which has influenced my development ethos and how I approach problem solving.

Feel free to analyze the code behind the website to learn more about my programming style and how it may benefit you or your organizations endeavors.

Thank you for taking the time to read this file and examine my work.
